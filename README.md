django-brackets
===============

This is a simple extension to add syntaxe highlighter for Django templates to Brackets

Thanks for [lh brackets syntax highlighter jinja2] for the help, that was so easy to make this extension after i saw his example, since the extension will just bring back what [already exists ;) ].

Road Map
--------------
The main idea was to use [Tornado] templates, since it is like the Django one, the trick it to use that extension, now, the second step, is trying to add [the code folding] support.
